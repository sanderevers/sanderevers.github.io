title: Penrose triangle in CSS
---
I'd like to present to you my latest creation, consisting of only CSS transformations and animations.

{% include penrose.html %}

<!--more-->

To produce the transformations I did some matrix math using a Javascript library.
Once again, this involved a [cube-to-hexagon projection](https://observablehq.com/@sanderevers/penrose-triangle-in-zesty-css).
