title: A blog

The reason I'm starting this blog is simple: I want to preserve some tech writings
I published in the past. They're on sites that are down or collecting bit-rot,
so I'll now host them here myself. Also, it's nice just to have everything in one
place.

I've opted for Jekyll on GitHub Pages because it seems to occupy a sweet spot in
static hosting, with low maintenance but high customizability, and (not unimportant)
at zero hosting cost. So far I'm quite happy with it.

I hope there will soon be more to read on this blog.
